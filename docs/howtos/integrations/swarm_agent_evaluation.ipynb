    "   - If the reason is invalid, the agent responds empathetically and explains the return policy to the customer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validate Eligibility**:  \n",
    "   The agent uses the `valid_to_return` tool to check if the product qualifies for a return based on the policy. Depending on the outcome, the agent provides a clear response to the customer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Initiate the Return**:  \n",
    "   If the product is eligible, the agent uses the `initiate_return` tool to start the return process and shares the next steps with the customer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Close the Case**:  \n",
    "   Before ending the conversation, the agent ensures the customer has no further questions. If everything is resolved, the agent uses the `case_resolved` tool to close the case.  \n",
